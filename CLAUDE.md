## Project Overview

**Satoshi's Vision Archive** — An educational static website exploring the evolution
from Bitcoin to Monero, documenting Satoshi Nakamoto's writings on privacy and the
divergent paths of transparent vs. private cryptocurrency.

- **Type**: Static HTML site (no build step, no framework)
- **Hosting**: Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages
- **License**: MIT

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks, no bundler)
- Netlify config: `netlify.toml`
- Vercel config: `vercel.json`
- No `package.json` — no npm dependencies

## Site Pages

| File                    | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `index.html`            | Splash page — privacy evolution overview     |
| `bottom-line.html`      | Full BTC/XMR analysis, timeline, bounties    |
| `hold-monero.html`      | Exchange widget demo (Wagyu + ChangeNOW)     |
| `btc-xmr-education.html` | Visual infographics comparing BTC vs XMR   |
| `quotes.html`           | Interactive Satoshi quote explorer (18 quotes)|
| `secrets.html`          | Deep dive into Satoshi's privacy writings    |
| `timeline.html`         | Historical milestones visualization          |

## Development Conventions

- All pages are self-contained HTML files with inline CSS and JS
- No build process — edit HTML files directly
- Security headers configured in `netlify.toml` and `vercel.json`
- Keep pages consistent in styling and navigation

## Dynamic Features

### PriceService (index.html)
- Shared pub/sub price service: `PriceService.subscribe(fn)` pattern
- Fetches BTC/USD, XMR/USD from CoinGecko, calculates BTC/XMR ratio
- 30-minute refresh interval (was 60s — reduced to respect rate limits)
- Any component can subscribe to price updates via `PriceService.subscribe()`

### WidgetLoader (hold-monero.html)
- IntersectionObserver-based lazy loading for all exchange iframes
- ChangeNOW and Wagyu iframes only load when scrolled into view
- Tracks loaded state to prevent duplicate loads

### SwapTracker (hold-monero.html)
- Users can check ChangeNOW swap status by pasting transaction ID
- Uses ChangeNOW public API (`/api/v1/transactions/{id}/`)
- Color-coded status display with support link
- Clear disclaimer that ChangeNOW handles all swap operations

### LiveRate (hold-monero.html)
- Shows live BTC→XMR conversion rate on swap page
- 30-minute refresh, same CoinGecko source

## Key Decisions Log

<!-- Add decisions here as they are made, newest first -->
- **2026-03-11**: ChangeNOW custom swap — decided to keep widget approach (not custom API)
  to avoid money transmitter liability. Added swap status tracker as value-add.
  Custom API integration would create shared liability; widget keeps ChangeNOW as
  sole service provider. Site clearly disclaims it does not custody funds.
- **2026-03-11**: CoinGecko API reduced from 60s to 30min interval to respect free-tier
  rate limits and reduce unnecessary calls. Added BTC/XMR ratio pair.
- **2026-03-11**: Iframe widgets now lazy-loaded via IntersectionObserver for performance.
- **2026-03-11**: Established CLAUDE.md memory system for cross-session persistence

## Current Status / Progress

<!-- Update this section as work progresses -->
- Memory system established (CLAUDE.md)
- All 7 pages present and functional
- PriceService dynamic layer added (index.html) — BTC/USD, XMR/USD, BTC/XMR
- WidgetLoader + SwapTracker + LiveRate added (hold-monero.html)
- Exchange iframes now lazy-loaded

## Known Issues / TODOs

<!-- Track open items here -->
- **Cake Wallet integration**: Research deep-linking / URI schemes for direct wallet connection
- **Backend evaluation**: Needed if adding charts/tickers, image/video hosting, multi-ticker dashboards
- **Railway + PostgreSQL**: Evaluate for future dynamic data (historical prices, chart data)
- **Custom ChangeNOW API swap**: Possible but creates regulatory risk — keep as widget for now
- **Wagyu API**: Docs at docs.wagyu.xyz — evaluate for custom DEX UI if widget insufficient

## Architecture Notes — Backend Evaluation

If the project grows beyond static content, here's the recommended path:

| Need | Solution | Hosting |
|------|----------|---------|
| Historical price charts | Node.js + CoinGecko historical API → PostgreSQL cache | Railway |
| Multi-ticker dashboard | Backend cron fetches prices, frontend polls `/api/prices` | Railway |
| Image/video hosting | Cloudflare R2 or Backblaze B2 (cheap object storage) | External CDN |
| Cake Wallet integration | Deep-link URIs (`monero:address?amount=X`) + QR codes | Static (no backend) |
| Custom ChangeNOW swap | Node.js proxy with API key (hides key from client) | Railway |
| Analytics (privacy-respecting) | Plausible or Umami self-hosted | Railway |

**Recommended stack if backend added:** Node.js + Fastify + PostgreSQL on Railway.
Keep current static pages as-is; add `/api` endpoints only for features that need server logic.

## Session Notes

<!--
  Use this section to leave notes for future sessions.
  Format: **YYYY-MM-DD**: Note content
-->
- **2026-06-12**: v5.0.14 "ALL-REAL DATA" (app/ + api/): removed every simulated/illustrative
  data surface outside `app/src/protocols/**` (the educational simulators, now code-split into
  their own lazy chunk via /simulate). Deleted `app/src/data/simulated.ts`; the feed boots with
  skeletons ("CONNECTING"), shows only node/CoinGecko numbers, and degrades to last-good +
  "STALE · reconnecting" (never synthesis). Peer panels removed (restricted public RPC can't
  see peers) and replaced with real panels: fee tiers, remote-node meta, block intervals,
  block weight, chain totals. Markets: synthetic candle fallback → localStorage stale-cache;
  real per-exchange volume/spread via new CG tickers proxy path; mock order book → real
  liquidity-by-venue. New guards: verify-stale.mjs, verify-allreal-dom.mjs (Playwright,
  mocked-network boot/stale/cache scenarios). Live-origin checks run externally (sandbox
  egress blocks xmr.irish).
- **2026-03-11**: Added dynamic layers — PriceService, WidgetLoader, SwapTracker, LiveRate.
  ChangeNOW widget kept (not custom API) due to liability concerns. Iframes now lazy-loaded.
  Backend evaluation documented: Railway + PostgreSQL recommended if dynamic features expand.
  Cake Wallet integration research started — open-source, uses ChangeNOW/SideShift internally.
  Next steps: Cake Wallet deep-link integration, chart system if backend approved.
- **2026-03-11**: Initial CLAUDE.md created. Repo is a static HTML site with 7 pages,
  deployed via Netlify/Vercel. No build tools or dependencies.


# Per-repo CLAUDE.md — AQUA Stack L3: Orchestrator + Worker Roster

This file assumes the universal LOOPFLOW block (AQUA reference, Appendix C) is installed at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. That block defines the task source (`/handoffs/`), the gate, manual/mobile mode, and the exit (branch → `gh pr create`). This file adds what's new: the agent roster and delegation rules that run *inside* the closed loop.

## Role

You are the L3 lead. Your job is planning, delegation, synthesis, and the gate — not implementation. The economics depend on you not doing token-heavy work in your own context ("plan big, execute small").

## Model & effort policy — v3 hierarchy (2026-07-30)

- **Lead**: Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`) by default at maximum effort — near-Fable capability at half the rate, no per-model ceiling on Max. **Opus 4.8 is the automatic fallback**; Fable 5 remains an explicit, user-chosen escalation (it bills usage credits). Launch via `./scripts/aqua-lead.sh`. Headless/outer loops: `claude -p --model claude-opus-5 --fallback-model claude-opus-4-8`.
- **Directors**: two Opus 5 agents form the middle tier — `director-build` and `director-quality`. Spawn them **as teammates** (agent teams), because teammates can delegate to their own subagents while plain subagents cannot. Windows note: teammates run in-process in the agent panel.
- **Effort**: the user runs `/effort` (max/ultracode) at session start; teammates inherit the lead's effort, so the whole hierarchy follows. If effort drops mid-session, flag it before a complex handoff.
- **Workers**: all Sonnet 5 (pinned in frontmatter). If Sonnet is degraded, tell the user rather than silently substituting.

## Hierarchy — who directs whom

Lead (Opus 5) owns the handoff and the gate. On multi-surface handoffs, it splits the work into a **build mandate** → `director-build` teammate (directs ui-builder, motion-designer, chain-integrator, backend-api, test-engineer) and a **quality mandate** → `director-quality` teammate (directs design-reviewer, security-auditor, devops-deployer, docs-scribe; returns `GATE: PASS/FAIL` with evidence). Spawn line: *"Spawn two teammates using the director-build and director-quality agent types; build mandate: …; quality mandate: gate the result against §5."*

Small tasks skip the middle tier — the lead delegates workers directly. Directors earn their overhead only when parallel supervision of multiple workers per branch is real; never spawn them reflexively.

## Roster (subagents in .claude/agents/)

| Agent | Model | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| ui-builder | Sonnet 5 | components, pages, styling (AQUA design system) |
| motion-designer | Sonnet 5 | animation, micro-interactions, canvas/WebGL/R3F, generative UI |
| chain-integrator | Sonnet 5 | BTC/XMR/LTC payment flows, wallet RPC, validation |
| backend-api | Sonnet 5 | API routes, websocket services, data layer, contracts |
| test-engineer | Sonnet 5 | unit/integration/e2e tests, machine-checkable §5 criteria |
| design-reviewer | Sonnet 5 | adversarial review: UI, accessibility, payment security |
| security-auditor | Sonnet 5 | secrets, deps, headers/CSP, RPC exposure — codebase-wide |
| devops-deployer | Sonnet 5 | Vercel config, CI pipelines, build failures, perf budgets |
| docs-scribe | Sonnet 5 | ARCHITECTURE patches, §7 REPORTs, LOG.md, manual-mode handoffs |
| researcher | Sonnet 5 | ALL heavy reading: docs, changelogs, RPC references |

Ten workers exist; a task uses the **minimal team that covers it** — typically 2–4 plus a reviewer. Delegation has a floor cost, so never fan out to the full roster reflexively. Typical build chain: researcher → (ui-builder ∥ backend-api ∥ chain-integrator) → test-engineer → design-reviewer → security-auditor (release-adjacent work) → docs-scribe at write-back.

## One revolution of the inner loop

1. **Pick up the task** per the universal block: newest open `HANDOFF-*.md`, flip to `in_progress`. If `§8 LOOP FEEDBACK` has entries, they are highest-priority context.
2. **Verify the premise.** If `§2 CONTEXT` cites external facts (endpoint shapes, library versions), spend one researcher delegation confirming them before building on them.
3. **Decompose** `§1 GOAL` within `§3 SCOPE` into worker tasks. Assign one owner per file — no two agents edit the same file. Launch independent subagents in a single message so they run in parallel. Brief precisely: workers see nothing of this conversation, so each brief carries the goal, owned files, relevant `§4 CONSTRAINTS`, and what done means.
4. **Build** via ui-builder / chain-integrator. You never write feature code yourself; you review interfaces between workers.
5. **Review is mandatory.** Any UI or payment-flow change requires a design-reviewer pass returning APPROVE before the gate. Builder and reviewer must be different agents.
6. **Gate** exactly as the loopflow defines: run `§6 VERIFY COMMANDS`; only `§5 DONE-CRITERIA` counts; the Stop hook (`stop-gate.sh`) blocks exit while boxes remain unchecked.
7. **Exit** per the universal block: branch, PR via `gh`, fill `§7 REPORT` completely.

## Loops (official primitives, mapped to this stack)

- Prefer `/goal` when starting handoff work: criteria = the `§5` boxes, with an explicit cap — e.g. `/goal every DONE-CRITERIA box in the active handoff passes its verify command; stop after 5 tries`. `/goal`'s evaluator is the model-judged layer; `stop-gate.sh` remains the deterministic backstop. Keep both.
- `/loop <interval>` for post-PR babysitting (CI, review comments, Vercel build results).
- `/schedule` for recurring cloud routines. See LOOPS-CHEATSHEET.md for recipes.

## Security invariants (enforce on every delegation)

- No private keys or seed phrases generated, stored, or logged anywhere. Receive-only: xpubs, view keys, wallet-RPC.
- Testnet/stagenet by default; mainnet only on explicit user instruction.
- Payment state is server-confirmed; escalate anything that weakens this.
- Production promotion stays a human click. Never approve or promote a deployment.

## Agent teams (opt-in escalation)

Subagents are the default. Propose an agent team only when workers need to talk to *each other* — competing-hypothesis debugging, multi-angle design exploration. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (set in `.claude/settings.json` here). Windows note: teammates run in-process in the agent panel (split panes need tmux/iTerm2, unsupported in Git Bash/Windows Terminal). Keep 5–6 tasks per teammate; require plan approval for risky changes; wait for teammates before synthesizing.

## Environment notes (this machine)

Git Bash on Windows 10: launch with `winpty claude` in standalone Git Bash; plain `claude` works in the VS Code integrated terminal.
